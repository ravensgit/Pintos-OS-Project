---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

To implement a non-busy-waiting sleep function, we need to track sleeping 
threads and their wake-up times. The following structures were added or changed:

In struct thread (from threads/thread.h):

	int64_t alarm_time;

	- This holds the specific system tick value when a 
	  sleeping thread should be awakened.

	struct list_elem alarm_elem;

	- This element allows a thread to be placed on a list, 
	  in this case, the sleepers list.


In devices/timer.c:

	static struct list sleepers;

	- A global list containing all threads that are currently sleeping.
	  It is kept sorted by alarm_time.


---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: Briefly describe what happens in a call to timer_sleep(),
>> including the effects of the timer interrupt handler.

When a thread calls timer_sleep(), it first calculates its target wake-up time. It 
then disables interrupts, adds itself to a global sleepers list that is kept sorted 
by wake-up time, and calls thread_block() to go to sleep. This immediately yields the 
CPU. The thread consumes no processor time until the timer interrupt handler, which 
runs on every clock tick, finds that the thread's wake-up time has been reached. 
At that moment, the handler removes the thread from the sleepers list and calls thread_unblock(), 
moving it to the ready queue so it can be scheduled to run again.


>> A3: What steps are taken to minimize the amount of time spent in
>> the timer interrupt handler?

The primary step to minimize time in the interrupt handler is maintaining 
the "sleepers" list in 'sorted order'. By keeping the list sorted by wake-up 
time, the handler only ever needs to check the thread at the very front. 
If that thread isn't ready to wake up, the handler knows that no other threads 
in the list are ready either and can exit immediately. This avoids a slow and 
inefficient scan of the entire list on every single tick.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> A4: How are race conditions avoided when multiple threads call
>> timer_sleep() simultaneously?

The main problem is that the global sleepers list is a shared resource. If multiple 
threads tried to add themselves to it at the same time, the list's pointers could get corrupted.
We avoid this by wrapping the list modification code inside a call to intr_disable(). 
This stops the OS from switching threads, so only one thread can be touching 
the list at any given moment. It has to finish its work before another thread can get a turn.


>> A5: How are race conditions avoided when a timer interrupt occurs
>> during a call to timer_sleep()?

This is pretty much the same issue, but the race is between a thread adding itself 
to the sleepers list and the timer interrupt trying to read from it. The solution is 
the same: the intr_disable() call in timer_sleep() also stops the timer interrupt 
from firing. This guarantees that the interrupt handler won't ever run in the middle 
of a list update and see a broken, half-modified list.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> A6: Why did you choose this design?  In what ways is it superior to
>> another design you considered?

The biggest reason for this design was to get rid of the old implementation's busy-waiting. 
Having a thread spin in a loop, wasting CPU cycles just to check the time, is incredibly inefficient. 
Our new design is much better because it uses thread_block() to put the thread completely to sleep, 
meaning it uses zero CPU resources while it waits. This frees up the processor to do actual work for 
other threads.

We also considered using a simple, unsorted list to keep track of sleeping threads. 
While that would have worked, it would have been slow. The timer interrupt would have 
to scan the entire list every time it ran, just to see if anyone's time was up. We decided 
to use a sorted list instead. It's a little more work to insert threads, but it makes 
the interrupt handler's job super fast, it just has to peek at the first thread. 
For something that runs 100 times a second, that small optimization makes a big difference.


             PRIORITY SCHEDULING
             ===================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> B1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

To handle priority scheduling and donation, we will add a few members to struct thread. 
The existing priority field will be used for the effective priority.

/* In struct thread threads/thread.h */

int base_priority;

- We'll use this to remember the thread's original priority, so we can correctly restore 
it after a temporary donation is no longer needed.


struct lock *waiting_on_lock;

- This will be a simple pointer that lets us know which lock a thread is stuck on, 
which is the starting point for a donation chain.


struct list locks_held;

- a thread can hold more than one lock, we'll use this list to track all of them. 
This will be important when a thread releases one lock but still holds others.



>> B2: Explain the data structure used to track priority donation.
>> Use ASCII art to diagram a nested donation.  (Alternately, submit a
>> .png file.)

We won't use a single, separate data structure to track donations. Instead, the donation 
chain will be an implicit structure formed by linking threads and locks together using the 
new members we're adding to struct thread.

When a high-priority thread H waits for a lock held by M, H's waiting_on_lock pointer points 
to the lock. The lock itself knows its holder is M. If M is also waiting on a lock held by L, 
this forms a chain that our donation logic will be able to walk up.

Here is a diagram for a nested donation, where thread H (prio 60) waits for a lock 
held by M (prio 30), who in turn waits for a lock held by L (prio 10).

  +-------------+      wants     +-------------+      holds      +-------------+
  | Thread H    | -------------> | Lock M      | <------------- | Thread M    |
  | Prio: 60    |                |             |                | Prio: 30    |
  +-------------+                +-------------+                +-------------+
                                                                        |
                                                                      wants
                                                                        |
                                                                        V
                                +-------------+      holds        +-------------+ 
                                | Thread L    |    -------------> | Lock L      | 
                                | Prio: 10    |                   |             |    
                                +-------------+                   +-------------+                



   Donation Path: H -----> M -----> L

   Result: L's and M's effective priorities will be boosted to 60.


---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B3: How do you ensure that the highest priority thread waiting for
>> a lock, semaphore, or condition variable wakes up first?

we'll just keep the waiters list for each synchronization primitive sorted by priority. 
Whenever a thread has to wait, instead of just adding it to the back of the list, 
we will use a function like list_insert_ordered() to place it in the correct spot.

Then, when the lock is released or the semaphore is upped, the code that wakes a thread up 
doesn't need to change. It will just grab the first thread from the list, which will now 
always be the one with the highest priority.

>> B4: Describe the sequence of events when a call to lock_acquire()
>> causes a priority donation.  How is nested donation handled?

Let's say a high-priority thread 'H' tries to acquire a lock held by a low-priority thread L.

- H will see the lock is taken and will add itself to the lock's waiters list.

- This is the trigger for donation. Our code will then immediately update L's priority. 
  It will check the priorities of all threads waiting for the lock and set L's effective 
  priority to the highest one.

- After its priority is updated, H will block and go to sleep.

Nested donation will be handled by making this update logic recursive. After we boost L's priority, 
we'll check if L itself is waiting for another lock. If it is, we'll repeat the process on the holder 
of that lock. This will continue all the way up the chain of waiting threads.


>> B5: Describe the sequence of events when lock_release() is called
>> on a lock that a higher-priority thread is waiting for.

When a thread L (which currently has a high, donated priority) releases a lock, 
a few things will happen in order.

- First, we'll update L's priority. The lock is removed from its locks_held list, 
  and its effective priority will be recalculated. Since it's no longer getting a donation 
  for this lock, its priority will likely drop back down.

- Next, the lock is released, and the highest-priority waiting thread (say, H) is woken up 
  and moved to the ready_list.

- Finally, we'll have to check if the current thread (L) should still be running. 
  Since a higher-priority thread (H) just became ready, and L's own priority just 
  dropped, L will almost certainly yield the CPU to H immediately.


---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> B6: Describe a potential race in thread_set_priority() and explain
>> how your implementation avoids it.  Can you use a lock to avoid
>> this race?

A race condition could happen in thread_set_priority() because it does two things: 
- it changes the thread's priority, 
- and then it checks if it needs to yield. 
The problem is what happens between those two steps.

Say a thread lowers its priority. An interrupt could fire right after the priority value 
is changed but before we check if a yield is needed. The interrupt handler could make a 
higher-priority thread ready to run. When the interrupt returns, our now low-priority thread 
would incorrectly continue to run for a short time.

To avoid this, we'll wrap the whole operation in intr_disable() and intr_enable(). We will 
turn off interrupts, change the priority, check the ready list, and then perform the yield 
if needed, all as one atomic operation. This will stop any interrupts from messing with the 
scheduling logic mid-way.

You can't really use a lock to fix this. A lock protects data from other threads, but it 
doesn't stop interrupts. The race here is with the scheduler itself, which is driven by 
interrupts. An interrupt handler can't try to acquire a lock, so a lock wouldn't prevent 
the race condition; you have to disable interrupts directly.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> B7: Why did you choose this design?  In what ways is it superior to
>> another design you considered?

We'll go with this design because it's a complete and direct way to solve the priority inversion problem. 
The plan to handle donations recursively up a chain of waiting threads should correctly cover all the 
required cases, including the tricky nested ones. Keeping all the new data members inside struct thread 
also feels like the cleanest approach; it avoids having to manage separate data structures for donations, 
which would probably be a headache.

A simpler design we considered was to only handle one level of donation. 
For instance, if H waits on M and M waits on L, we could have just donated H's priority to M 
and stopped there. This would have been easier to code, but it would fail the nested donation 
requirement, so it wasn't a real option. Our current plan, while more complex, will be more correct 
and robust.
